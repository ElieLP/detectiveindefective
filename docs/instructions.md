## Build an AI Copilot for Factory Quality Teams

### 🚀 Challenge Vision - Why This Matters
Every factory produces Non-Conformity Reports (NCRs).
They are everywhere... and yet almost no one really uses them well.
Hidden inside these reports are:
- Recurring machine failures
- Weak suppliers
- Fragile process steps
- Training gaps
- Early warning signals before bigger incidents happen.

### Your mission: build an AI-powered assistant that turns raw NCR text into clear insights, recommendations, and decisions.
This is not a finished product, but a Proof of Concept to test how far AI can go in:
- Accelerating quality analysis
- Revealing hidden patterns
- Supporting engineers during production ramp-ups.

### Input data = Excel / CSV only (no system integration) ~100 NCRs
### Dataset = small, anonymized, realistic
All data is anonymized and safe to use

### The goal is impact, not perfection.
What Your AI Should Do (Pick What You Want to Showcase):
- Automatically extract key elements from NCR text: defect type, operation or process step, machine, supplier, operator
- Group NCRs by: similarity, defect families, machines or suppliers involved... and detect recurring patterns.
- Based on historical cases: suggest likely root causes, propose corrective actions, highlight what worked before
- Enable simple questions like: "Show similar NCRs involving MACHINE_01", "What defects keep coming back on this process?", "Which suppliers appear most often in NCRs?"
- Create simple dashboards showing: trends over time, top defect families, machines or suppliers with weak signals

### Why This Challenge Is Cool
- Real industrial data (not toy examples)
- Strong AI storytelling potential
- Clear before/after demo effect
- Appeals to AI, data, industrial, and product-minded teams
- Easy to demo, hard to master
